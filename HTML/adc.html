                <h2>AD Carry</h2>
                <p>
                    Ad carry is the main damage dealing role of the team. They have reliable and constant damage and when they manage to 
                    get their item will be able to shred to any champion they encounter. In the early game your main focus as an ad carry 
                    is to farm as many minions as you can while looking to punish your enemy when is try to last hit. If done correctly 
                    this will lead to you having a farm advantage as well as winning trades. Try to push the wave under their tower as fast 
                    as you can so the enemy ad carry loses minions to their turret. Do keep in mind this will leave you wide open to any 
                    forms of ganking so vision is crucial at this point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later in the game when team fights start to happen your goals is to simply stay back and safe while dealing as much 
                    damage as you can. Keep in mind you're a prime target for the enemy and they will always prioritize you if give the change. 
                    Because of this your main objective is to always stay safe first. If this means you have to join a team fight a few seconds 
                    later to wait out certain abilities then this is fine. Because of your overwhelming high damage you should not be concerned 
                    about trying to kill high priority targets on the enemy team but simple hit whatever is closest to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ad carry come in two main types. The either shine early game where they dominate their lane opponent and try to close out the 
                    game as early as possible before their damage falls off. The other option is an ad carry who is extremely weak early game 
                    but keeps getting stronger. If an ad carry like this reaches late game and plays well he will most likely be able to kill the 
                    entire enemy team as long as he is given the proper support. As a carry that shines early game your objective is to win your lane 
                    as hard as you possibly can. You do this by looking for fights and killing your lane opponent. Try to kill their turret as fast 
                    as you can and after this you should rotate to another lane to take those turrets as well. This will shift the global gold 
                    advantage towards your team and making them stronger as well. An ad carry that shines late game should try to just survive the early 
                    game. Get as much farm as you can and if you can get a kill go for it but your main priority should be to get farm and not die. 
                    There is a good chance that regardless of not dying you will lose your tower first this is fine remember your strength will be 
                    in the mid till late game not the early game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The summoner spells that are normally used on an ad carry are flash and heal or flash and cleanse. Almost every game you will run 
                    heal. It gives you utility as it will give you more movement speed when you use it on top of healing you. You can use heal to gain 
                    back life in a clutch fight and run away or use the speed to go after your enemy. Do keep in mind heal also heals 1 ally near you 
                    so you can use this to save your support. Cleanse is only ever picked if you face an enemy team which has a lot of stuns. Because of 
                    this you a high chance they will stun lock you and be dead before you can ever do anything. Cleanse prevents this by removing all 
                    stuns and debuffs so that you can move freely again and get out of the way before they catch you again.
