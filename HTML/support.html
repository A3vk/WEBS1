                <h2>Support</h2>
                <p>
                    Support is an interesting role. It is the only role in the game where your main objective is not to get more gold by farming minions or neutral 
                    monsters. Your main goal as a support is to support your ad carry. You do this to stick to his side and if he is in danger help him. As a support 
                    you should be the main shot caller for bot lane. Keep as much vision as you can with wards and look for possible ganks. The reason for all of 
                    this is that the ad carry is far to busy to notice everything. He is constantly trying to farm minions while also looking for ways to trade 
                    with the enemy or kill them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your overall goal as a support should be to keep your ad carry safe while he gets farm and kills if possible. So that later in the game your 
                    ad carry can be the main damage source for the entire team. When team fights start to happen your goal should be to stick around your ad carry 
                    and peel for them so that they can keep the damage up while being relatively safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supports come in a lot of different flavors but in the end they fall in 3 main categories; poke, sustain and hard engage. A poke supports is a 
                    champion whole had a reliable way of dealing damage to the enemy while being safe them self. If you pick a support like this you should try to 
                    deal as much damage to the enemy as you can as to keep their health low. Because of this it will be hard for the enemy to fight you or even get 
                    near their minions as the changes they are killed will be too great. A poke support is strong against hard engage supports since they will always 
                    have too little health to engage and start a fight. In the current meta there has been a shift to where poke supports are also played by some 
                    mages who you normally see mid. Sustain supports are champions who have a heal. Your role in this set up should be to sit back and heal as much 
                    damage as you can. Sustain supports are normally strong against poke supports since they will never be able to get you low enough that you have 
                    to fear anything. The last supports are har engage supports. These are normally tanks that have some way to get into the enemy and use crowd control 
                    effects to keep them at bay. Your goal should be to look for an opening to jump the enemy ad carry so your ad carry can get the kill. This setup is 
                    mostly strong against sustain supports since they won't get the opportunity to heal their ad carry over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For summoner spells you have 2 main options as a support. You either run flash and exhaust or flash and ignite. Exhaust is a spell to have since it 
                    slows the enemy down and weakens their damage. Because of this it will most likely result in you winning the fight. Ignite is chosen when you feel 
                    there is a need for more overall damage in a fight.
                </p>
