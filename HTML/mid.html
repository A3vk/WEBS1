                <h2>Mid Lane</h2>
                <p>Mid lane is the center point on the map. Playing in this lane will require you to have above average map awareness since your lane is so central to the map you can expect a lot of ganking and attention from other lanes. Since mid lane has two entrances to the lane on either side you won't be able to ward and have vision on both sides of at once. To compensate for this you will have to choose which side you want to wait and stick as much to that side of the lane as you can. By doing so you will force possible ganks to take the long route towards you giving you time to react while having vision on your side preventing ganks entirely as long as your ware enough.</p>
                <p>As for mid lane your goal should be to snowball yourself and the game for an easy win. The best way you can do this is by roaming to the other lanes and ganking them resulting in possible kills and objectives. Do note that roaming at the wrong time can be devastating to you and put you behind more than any other thing in the game besides maybe dying.  In the later parts of the game you will be responsible for dealing as much damage as you can for your team while remaining safe. The only exception to this are ad casters which we will come back on a little later.  If you do decide to pick an ad caster do keep in mind your team need to have at least one ap damage champion in the team or you will most likely lose the game.</p>
                <p>In mid there is usually a choice between two types of champions mages and ad casters. Mages excel in loads of damage while remaining from a safe distance. They often have skill shots that with high damage meant to harass the enemy and whittle their opponent down. At later levels mages tend to have high amounts of burst that can kill an enemy champion with one skill rotation. Ad casters on the other hand excel at bursting their opponent down. As an ad caster you want your opponent to be around the middle of the lane so when you do engage and burst them down you have the opportunity to chase after them if they survive. Ad caster are almost always melee champions which puts you at a disadvantage in the early game against mages. The play style of an ad caster is to get in kill a high propriety target and get out before they die themselves.</p>
                <p>For mid lane the most picked spells are flash and ignite. Flash offers great offensive and defensive capabilities by giving you a shirt range blink while ignite gives you more damage in a fight. If you expect to struggle with keeping yourself alive you might want to opt for barrier which gives you a short lasting shield that can help you survive high bursts of damage.</p>
