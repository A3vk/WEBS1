                <h2>Top Lane</h2>
                <p>Top lane can be a hard lane to wrap your head around at first. With so many different possibilities and options, it is one of the most diverse lanes in the game. At the same time top lane is the most isolated lane in comparison to the others. This results in the number of ganks being lower than in other lanes causing individual skill to shine more in the top lane.  All of this is great as long as you manage to win against your lane opponent. But if you lose you will probably have a rough game ahead of you. </p>
                <p>Being behind in top lane is the worst thing that can happen to you. You won't be able to fight or contest you lane opponent any longer resulting in a loss of vision, minions and overall lane control. The single best thing you can do when you behind is building defensive stats. These stats cause you to be relevant to your team in later fights by soaking damage for the rest of them and make it easier for you to survive against your already ahead lane opponent. </p>
                <p>The champions that are mostly played in top lanes are tanks or fighters. Tanks usually are champions with more defensive abilities and lots of crowd control. They tend to build only defensive items making them a nightmare to bring down in team fights while making sure their enemies won't get away from them by using their crowd control. Fighters, on the other hand, are champions who excel a dueling 1 on 1. Their abilities tend to have a more aggressive focus with maybe 1 defensive spell in the mix. These champions normally build a mix of defensive and offensive items. This ratio tends to shift depending on if they are behind or ahead. While team fighting it is their job to attack the enemies carry and is possible kill them. Lastly there is the more uncommon top lane picks the damage dealers. Champions that are damage dealers in the top lane excel at dissing out enormous amounts of damage at the cost of survivability. They only build offensive items and need to get ahead early to stay relevant throughout the game. Once the team fighting starts they tend to stay behind more looking for a safe opening in which they can start throwing out all their damage. </p>
                <p>The summoner spells that are normally used in top lane are flash and teleport. Teleport gives you the possibility to help your team anywhere on the map if they need it. Because of this you can be in your isolated top lane while still being able to help your team anywhere on the map the moment they need it. In some cases you can decide you take ignite over teleport. By doing so you lose the potential to help your team out when needed but you gain much more kill potential making room for you to get fed early game and carry your team to victory. In rare cases you might want to change one of your summoners spells for ghost. This allows champions that are easily kited to counter that.</p>

                            is foolish enough o wander into his territory.  Trundle can turn any environment into his terrain slowing 
                            enemies while giving movement speed and attack speed to himself. Creating a huge pillar of ice he will block

                            new purpose in his companion Ashe. Tryndamereâ€™s furry knows no bounds as he gains furry with each attack 
                            increasing his critical change. Spinning onto the field of battle a mere shout from him is enough to slow
