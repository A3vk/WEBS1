                <h2>Jungle</h2>
                <p>
                    Jungle is the only role where you won’t be having a direct lane opponent to fight against. Instead you will be farming 
                    neutral monsters in your side of the jungle. By doing this you gain the advantage that the enemy team never truly knows 
                    where you are unless you show yourself. Use this to your advantage and gank lanes that overextend. By doing this will 
                    create a lead for yourself and also your team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a jungler it will be your job to secure dragon and rift herald or later in the game Baron Nasher. Dragon and rift herald 
                    can be done by ganking top or bot to kill the enemy. This will give you the opening to secure those objectives. Baron is a 
                    little more complicated most likely you will have to wait till a team fight is won so that you have time to kill baron 
                    without fear of the enemy stealing baron or engaging on you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jungle champions have three overarching categories: tank, fighter and assassin. A tank will have high amounts of crowd control 
                    making ganks easier. In the later stages of the game they will supports their team by being very hard to kill and control the 
                    enemy as well as they can. Fighters are your main frontline component. They are not as hard to kill as a tank but are still pretty 
                    durable. When ganking they use their strong dual potential to kill the enemy and snowball them self till a point there is no 
                    stopping them. Lastly the assassin. Assassins use the element of surprise to overpower their enemy's and kill them before they can 
                    react. Assassins should look to ganks as much as possible so that they get kills. This is important since if an assassin falls behind 
                    he will most likely not be very useful during the game. In team fights you should look for an opening to kill a high priority target 
                    and get out before you get killed yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For summoners spells you can choose between flash and ghost while always having smite. Flash can be used for utility be offering a 
                    short distance blink while ghost gives you more movement speed for champions who need it. Smite is a must for the jungle it will deal 
                    a lot of damage to neutral monsters as well as heal you. This can be used on bigger targets like dragon and baron for the last bit 
                    of hp they have so that the enemy won't be able to steal it. Besides all of this smite will allow you to buy the jungle items in 
                    the shop which will make farming monsters in the jungle a whole lot easier.

                        <p>
                            loyal to the ruling Lightshield dynasty Xin Zhao Once forced as a gladiator in Noxus he was freed by 
                            Demacian forces and swore loyalty to his new liberators. Xin Zhao charges into combat with his 
                            three talon spear knocking up enemies on his third hit. Trying to get away from him he slashes 
                            with his spear slowing his enemies. His ultimate creates a guarding circle around him preventing 
                            him from taking damage unless his enemy is inside the circle.

                        <h3>Zac</h3>
                        <p>
                            The product of a toxic spill that ran through a chemtech seam and pooled in an isolated cavern 
                            deep in Zaun’s Sump Zac became sentient helping people who cannot help themselves. 
                            Because he is made out of slime Zac can stretch his arms grabbing two enemies and smashing them 
                            into each other. For his ultimate he flattens himself waiting for enemies to walk on top of him when 
                            they do he bounces away taking them with him.
